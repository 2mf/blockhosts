[2012 Package. May not work anymore!]

Block IP Addresses based on login or access information in system logs.

Updates a hosts blockfile (such as hosts.allow) automatically,
to block IP addresses. Will also expire previously blocked addresses
based on age of last failed login attempt, this keeps the blockfile
size manageable.

In addition to TCP_WRAPPERS, can also execute iptables or ip commands
to block all TCP/IP network input from an IP address, so all services,
even those that do not run under libwrap TCP_WRAPPERS, can be protected.

An email notification facility is also available.
